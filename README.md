# skip

`skip` is a simply but mighty library for creating textual format parsers. It validates and finds the bounds of numbers, strings, and ids. It also unescapes and decodes strings. It handles \n, \xXX, \uXXXX\uYYYY, utf-8 for you.

It's used for parsers: [json](https://pkg.go.dev/nikand.dev/go/json), [csv](https://pkg.go.dev/nikand.dev/go/jq/jqcsv), [url](https://pkg.go.dev/nikand.dev/go/jq/jqurl).
