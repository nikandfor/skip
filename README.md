# skip

`skip` is a simple yet powerful library for creating textual format parsers. It validates and finds the bounds of numbers, strings, and IDs. It also unescapes and decodes strings, handling \n, \xXX, \uXXXX\uYYYY, and UTF-8 for you.

It's used for parsers: [json](https://pkg.go.dev/nikand.dev/go/json), [csv](https://pkg.go.dev/nikand.dev/go/jq/jqcsv), [url](https://pkg.go.dev/nikand.dev/go/jq/jqurl).
